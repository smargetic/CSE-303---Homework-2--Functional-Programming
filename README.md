Functional Programming


Problem 1:
A)
B)
C)Takes in a list, and a number.
The number is the base of the power function.
The list holds the constant that multiplies the power function. The index of the list is the exponent.

Ex. evalPoly([10.0, 3.0, 1.0], 2.0) = 10.0*(2.0)^0 + 3.0*(2.0)^1 +1.0*(2.0)^2 = 10.0 + 6.0 + 4.0 = 20.0
